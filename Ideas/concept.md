Concept
=======

* A group of tools, not a framework
* Good support for working with time
* Lightweight
* Support 3d and 2d games and experiences
* Client/server model? A 'god' client that can hook into the process
* Kind of like a text editor (emacs, sublime, lighttable) where you can bind functions to buttons
* Easy to make UI stuff
