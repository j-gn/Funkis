Concept
=======

* A group of tools, not a framework
* Good support for working with time
* Lightweight, easy to start a new project and get going
* Support 3d and 2d games and experiences
* Client/server model (?)
* A 'god' client that can hook into the process and control things while someone is playing
* Kind of like a text editor (emacs, sublime, lighttable) where you can bind functions to buttons
* Easy to make UI stuff, windows etc
* Very good inspection tools
* Easy to serialize the correct parts of the game state and save/load/reset/etc
* Possible to swap out pieces of the engine
* Good defaults for working with level editing and entity creation
